# CSE491 Section 2, 2016 Fall
## Introduction to Machine Learning
Instructor: [Jiayu Zhou](http://0xmachine.com) [[email](mailto:jiayuz@msu.edu)]



Time: Monday and Wednesday 10:20am - 11:40am

Location: Engineering Building, **EB 2205**  

Office Hours: TBA, EB 2134


## Course Description
Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience (e.g., that learn to spot high-risk medical patients, recognize speech, classify text documents, detect credit card fraud, or drive autonomous robots). This course provides an in-depth understanding of machine learning and statistical pattern recognition techniques and their applications in biomedical informatics, computer vision, and other domains.

Tentative Topics: probability distributions, regression, classification, kernel methods, clustering, semi-supervised learning, mixture models, graphical models, dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, sparse learning, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and Hidden Markov Models.

Homework assignments include both theoretic derivation and hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. 

## Recommended Background
In this course you will be extensively involved a variety of math topics, especially, linear algebra and matrix computation, basics about probability theory and numerical optimization. An online quiz will be available before the class for self-assessment.  

## Course Announcements
Announcements will be emailed to the course mailing list. A welcome note will be sent to the mailing list at the beginning of the semester.  If you do not receive the welcome message before the first class, please [send mail to me](mailto:jiayuz@msu.edu).
